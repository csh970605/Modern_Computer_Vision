For combining color and depth information, we used the probabilistic model based on Gaussian distribution. In particular, we focused on solving color camouflage problem and depth denoising. For evaluating our method, we built a new dataset containing normal, color camouflage and depth camouflage situations. The dataset files consist of color, depth and ground truth image sequences. With these files, we compared the proposed algorithm with the conventional color-based BGS techniques in terms of precision, recall and F-measure. As a result, our method showed the best performance. Thus, this technique will help to robustly detect regions of interest as pre-processing in high-level image processing stages.\n","\n","\n","Link to Paper - https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283026260_Background_subtraction_based_on_Gaussian_mixture_models_using_color_and_depth_information\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"vP3Fyj7Zx3eg","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1685007823765,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":284,"user":{"displayName":"최세훈","userId":"00148754616075165078"}}},"source":["cap = cv2.VideoCapture('walking_short_clip.mp4')\n","\n","# Get the height and width of the frame (required to be an interger)\n","w = int(cap.get(3)) \n","h = int(cap.get(4))\n","\n","out = cv2.VideoWriter('walking_output_1.avi', cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'mp4v'), 30, (w, h), isColor=False)\n","\n","# Initlaize background subtractor\n","foreground_background = cv2.bgsegm.createBackgroundSubtractorMOG()\n","\n","while True:\n","    \n","    ret, frame = cap.read()\n","\n","    if ret: \n","      # Apply background subtractor to get our foreground mask\n","      foreground_mask = foreground_background.apply(frame)\n","      out.write(foreground_mask)\n","    else:\n","      break\n","\n","cap.release()\n","out.release()"],"execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1I7zpPIHMI8XKn4DD2oBM_pnwcbQ5bhAp\">\n"],"metadata":{"id":"KwzBRhKzTQIh"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"I_Q2GnPezaUL"},"source":["### **Let's try the Improved adaptive Gausian mixture model for background subtraction**\n","\n","Background subtraction is a common computer vision task.
